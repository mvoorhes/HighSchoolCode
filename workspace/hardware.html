            <h2 class="computerparts">Motherboard</h2>
            <p class="computerparts">The motherboard is the skeleton of the computer. It's the part that holds all of your other parts like your cpu, your RAM, your Hard Drive, etc. The quality of a motherboard is determined by the slots it supports. There are 2 different socket types of motherboards, AMD motherboards and intel motherboards. The difference between these is that the AMD motherboards support amd cpus and Intel motherboards support Intel CPUs, so if you tried using your intel cpu on an amd motherboard, it won't work. There are different motherboard sizes (form factor), most common being ATX motherboards which are for standard size computers and microATX motherboards which are for more compact computers.</p>

            <h2 class="computerparts">CPU/Processor</h2>
            <p class="computerparts">The cpu (central processing unit) is usually considered to be the "brain" of the computer. It's the part that is responsible for executing all of the commands you give to your computer, so if you wanted your computer to solve 2+2, the CPU is the part of the computer that would solve that problem. There are many things that go into a cpu, such as how fast the cpu is or how much it can handle at one time. The speed of a cpu is measured in hertz and what reads and executes program instructions in a cpu is called a core.</p>

            <h2 class="computerparts">RAM</h2>
            <p class="computerparts">RAM is an acronym for "Random Access Memory" which is a type of computer memory that can be accessed randomly. RAM is the most common type of memory that is found in computers. There are many different types of RAM out there such as DDR3 which is the most common type of RAM out there, SIMM RAM, and SD RAM. The memory part of RAM is measured in bytes, most commonly in gigabytes. The most common amount of RAM that's in a computer is usually around 4-8 gigabytes.</p>

            <h2 class="computerparts">Hard Drive</h2>
            <p class="computerparts">The hard drive in a computer is the part that stores all of your information in your computer, such as games, music, movies, programs, etc. The most common type of hard drive you'll find is an HDD (Hard Disk Drive)(pictured on the left) which can hold a lot of storage but are slow in comparison to other types of hard drives like SSDs (Solid State Drive) which are incredibly fast but lacking in storage. Hard drives are usually measured in bytes of storage or how fast they are. The most common storage found in hard drives is around 250 gigabytes to 1 terrabyte (1 terrabyte is 1024 gigabytes).</p>

            <h2 class="computerparts">Video Card</h2>
            <p class="computerparts">The video card (AKA graphics card) is the part that lets you play games on your computer. Even though most CPUs already come with built in graphics, many people will buy a seperate video card for their computer so they can have good performance in games when gaming. Just like a cpu, there is a lot that goes into a video card, such as vram which provides a buffer for frames that are generated by the graphics card, or the gpu (graphics processing unit) which is the cpu for generating graphics.</p>

            <h2 class="computerparts">Sound Card</h2>
            <p class="computerparts">The sound card in a computer is the part of a computer that allows the use of audio components for multimedia applications, so if you're listening to a song, that's where a sound card will come into play. Unlike all of the other parts mentioned previously, sound cards are starting to become obsolete with the introduction of hdmi audio on video cards.</p>

            <h2 class="computerparts">How do these parts work together?</h2>
            <p class="computerparts">How they work together is when you put them onto the motherboard, they will start to communicate with eachother through the cpu.</p>

            <h2 class="computerparts">Keyboard</h2>
            <p class="computerparts">A keyboard is an input device to type characters (letters, numbers, etc.) onto the computer, similar to what a typewriter is to paper. You can use a keyboard to search for anything on the internet. There really isn't a measurement for how good a keyboard other than if the material is good.</p>

            <h2 class="computerparts">Mouse</h2>
            <p class="computerparts">A mouse is an input device used to move the cursor on the screen (more on the screen later). The mouse is typically used for clicking on links on a web browser and for opening programs. There are many different types of mice such as a gaming mouse which looks much different than the mouse pictured on the left and has many more buttons than just 2 (3 if you count the scroll click).</p>

            <h2 class="computerparts">Monitor</h2>
            <p class="computerparts">A monitor is a display device that displays what is happening on the computer. It is the screen for the computer. The quality of the monitor is determined by how fast the monitor can keep up with the computer (refresh rate) and how the image quality looks (resolution). As of April 11, 2012, the most common monitor resolution is 1366x768 and the most common refresh rate is 60 hertz (60 frames per second).</p>
